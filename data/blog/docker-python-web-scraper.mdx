## The problem
I want to buy a motorcycle, and there is a website which has a lot of motorcycles for sale. The problem is that it does not have the filters I want, so I will get the data I need, and copy it to a mysql database, which I can query later, to get the motorcycle I want.

## Set up the project
First I need to install PyCharm, community edition. This is the best python editor I worked with. If you already have your favourite editor installed, you can skip this step.

I am using Ubuntu, so I go to https://snapcraft.io/, and search for PyCharm. There I click on the community edition, and on the detail page, if I click Install, the following command appears, which I need to run:
```sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic```

I create an empty folder somewhere, then open PyCharm, click Open Project, and open my folder there.

## Setting up docker
Crate a `docker-compose.yml` file.
