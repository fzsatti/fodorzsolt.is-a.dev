## The idea

I want to create an app to track my son's age—he was born in June, and I'd like to see his age in months, weeks, and days. Inspired by this, I also want the app to track other milestones, like how long I've been at my current job and similar events.

## Setting up the project

The app will be done in [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/), using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcdn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

To initialize the project I ran the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest time-spent-since --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```
