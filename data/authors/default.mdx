I am a seasoned web developer with over a decade of experience crafting robust digital solutions.

My backend journey began with core PHP, and I honed my skills through frameworks like CodeIgniter 2 and Laravel, building everything from simple websites to complex APIs and web applications. My expertise expanded to Symfony, where I developed microservices and applications, and I’ve also maintained microservices in Python and explored Go for certain projects. I enjoy using Python for task automation and have experience with platforms like WordPress, Magento, Shopware, and Prestashop, including plugin development.

On the frontend, my foundations lie in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, evolving through jQuery and advancing to modern frameworks like Vue.js, React, and Angular. My work extends beyond web to mobile app development using Ionic.

For data storage, I started with MySQL, later incorporating MongoDB for specific projects. I’ve also embraced event-driven architecture, leveraging Apache Kafka to build scalable microservices.

With a passion for innovation and a breadth of experience across technologies, I thrive on delivering efficient and elegant solutions tailored to diverse needs.
